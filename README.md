####Favorite Project: MBTA Transit Map

This project was a very cool and very useful application, which used the Google Maps API and JSON to display various MBTA subway lines.  It was able to determine the closest station to your location, and show a table of upcoming trains for any station.

####Project I'm Most Proud Of: 2048 Game Center

2048 is so addictive it even took over this class!  For this project, a server-side application was developed to store high scores in a database, which could be retrieved from an external origin.  I am especially proud of this project, because I feel that it is a simple, clean, and efficient solution to the problem.

This class has been critical in my development as a web programmer.  Although many of the tools and skills were not completely new to me, the formal education and focused practice gave me a much deeper understanding, as well as a good start to a portfolio.
